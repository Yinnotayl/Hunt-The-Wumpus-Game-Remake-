## ⚠️ Hazards

There are **3 types of dangers** in the cave:

* **Wumpus**: If you're next to it, you’ll smell a stench. If you enter its cell—you lose.
* **Bottomless Pit**: You’ll feel a breeze nearby. Falling in means game over.
* **Bats**: You’ll hear flapping. If you enter a bat cell, they’ll carry you to a random location—which could be dangerous!

### Shooting & Arrows

* If you **shoot and miss**, the Wumpus moves (but not to your location).
* You may find a new arrow on the ground after missing.
* If you hit the Wumpus, you win!

* **Toggle Entities**: Reveal or hide hazard locations on the grid.
* **Grid Size**: Adjust the game board size (minimum 3×3, up to 100×100).
* **Restart Button**: Resets the game with new hazard placements.
